OpenSim-CMS API
===============
The OpenSim-CMS communicates with OpenSim objects through an JSON-API, based on REST.

## User

User information can be accessed by using, the UUID of the user is based on the user's UUID in OpenSim:

```
GET /api/user/<UUID>/
```

Example of output

```json
{
    "uuid": "0a1811f4-7174-4e42-8bb5-26ef78335407",
    "userName": "testuser",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "email": "testuser@email.com",
    "presentationIds": [
        "1",
        "5",
        "8"
    ]
}
```

To match an UUID of a user to the user in the CMS the following command can be used.
Some form of authentication will be added later on. By sending a POST request to the server with the CMS
username as parameter and the UUID of the user in OpenSim.

```
POST /api/user/<UUID>/

userName=<USERNAME>
```

## Presentation

To retrieve a specific presentation use the following command and replace the id with the number of the
presentation you want to get. The trailing / is optional.

```
GET /api/presentation/<ID>/
```

Example of output when request is successful:

```json
{
    "type": "presentation",
    "title": "Test Presentatie",
    "presentationId": "1",
    "ownerUuid": "3fedbbf8-465c-499c-9c2d-3fba9ed61701",
    "slides": {
        "1": {
            "number": "1",
            "url": "http://localhost:80/OpenSim-CMS/api/presentation/1/slide/1/",
            "uuid": "1be74003-2d7c-4dbd-87c2-a1c95e0864e6",
            "uuidUpdated": "2014-02-13 14:55:27",
            "uuidExpired": "0"
        },
        "2": {
            (...)
        },
        (...)
    },
    "slidesCount": "14",
    "creationDate": "2014-02-13 14:21:47",
    "modificationDate": "2014-02-13 14:22:09"
}
```
The UUID is matched to the UUID generated by OpenSim when the slide is accessed, to enable caching of textures.
This is done by using the POST function for a single slide (see below).

The given URL will provide a jpg of the slide resized and centered at 1024x1024 with a black background.

```
GET /api/presentation/<ID>/slide/<SLIDE #>/
```

When an slide has been processed by OpenSim an UUID is generated for the texture, this UUID can be stored with
the slide to speed up future use. The cache periode is set in the `OpenSim.ini` configuration and needs to be
matched by the `OS_ASSET_CACHE_EXPIRES` value in `config.php`.

```
POST /api/presentation/<ID>/slide/<SLIDE #>/

uuid=<UUID>
```
