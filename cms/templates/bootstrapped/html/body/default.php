    <h1>OpenSim-CMS <small>RESTful client</small></h1>
    <p class="lead">This client uses JavaScript to access the OpenSim-CMS API. </p>
</div>
<p>
    For a full documentation of the used API see <a href="https://www.github.com/nielswitte/OpenSim-CMS/" target="_blank">https://www.github.com/nielswitte/OpenSim-CMS/</a>.
    This CMS allows you to use the functions of the API to set up a meeting in the virtual environment of OpenSim. This CMS is part of my Master Thesis with the subject of
    <i>"Develop a Content Management System to Increase the Usability of a 3D Virtual Environment"</i>.
