The functions of the API can be accessed by using the OpenSim-CMS. The CMS is a client of the API and only uses HTML5 and JavaScript to access functionalities offered by the server (the API). This section describes the options available in the CMS and how to use them.

## Buttons
The buttons in the CMS are identifiable by their color. For example all buttons to submit data to the API, for example create a new User account, are `blue`. Buttons that cancel such a request or remove something are `red`. Buttons which perform small actions such as filter the visible information or add new information, for example add a document to a meeting, are `green`. All buttons which navigate you to another page, open a dialog, or show a form are `white`.

## Notifications
Feedback from the API will be provided in the top right corner by a notification. The color indicates the result. `Green` notifications will be shown for successful requests, when the notifications turn `orange` you receive a warning and when they are `red` an error has occurred. Some request will return a `blue` notification, this is just simple feedback to inform you that you can continue and should not expect any problems.
